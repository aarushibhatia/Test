# Push Notifications Methods - 

1. AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)

    It is a pub/sub (publish-subscribe) service. Whenever something about a "topic" is published,
    be it through events or something else, notification to its subscribers is sent. It works the
    best if there are more people. It works in 2 modes: A2A (Application to Application) and
    A2P (Application to Person). the A2P functionality enables one to send messages to users at 
    scale via SMS, mobile push, and email.

2. Service Worker in node.js


    A client app installs a service worker. It is an autonomously working script in the browser. So even if the tab with the application is not currently open, the service worker will accept and show a notification.
    A user receives a request to display notifications.
    After accepting permission to display notifications, the browser hands credentials and other service information to the app. This data must be sent to the backend and stored in the db.
    Using the previously received credentials, the backend makes a request to the service provider, which in turn sends a notification to the service worker.
    The service worker receives a notification and shows it.

    Steps to implement this:

    Step 1: Starting the Node.js application and getting VAPID keys.
    Step 2: Creating a worker service.
    Step 3: Subscribe to notifications.
    Step 4: Getting credentials on the backend side and sending a notification.
